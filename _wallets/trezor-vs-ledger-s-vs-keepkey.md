For a while, the TREZOR was the only hardware wallet on the market. Now, KeepKey and the Ledger Nano S have been released and have created great competition in the hardware wallet market. Not only has the competition lowered prices, but it makes choosing the right hardware wallet a tough decision. 

This comparison will show you which wallet is better in different categories for TREZOR vs. KeepKey vs. Ledger Nano S.

## Price

The Ledger Nano S is the cheapest wallet of the three by far.

## Screen

For a while, the TREZOR was the only hardware wallet with a screen. Since a screen is such an important security feature for a hardware wallet it was clear that more would be created.

## Security 

## Setup 

All three wallets are very easy to setup. 

## Size & Design

![trezor vs. ledger nano s vs. keepkey ](/img/wallets/tlk.jpg){: .img-responsive .kb-helper}

As seen in the image above, the TREZOR is by far the mallest of the three devices. Each wallet does have some unique differences that are hard to see in the picture. 

The TREZOR and Ledger Nano S both have two physical buttons, while the KeepKey has one. 

The KeepKey's screen is much bigger than the other two wallets. As mentioned earlier, the KeepKey's larger screen means it can be securely recovered using a cipher which leaks less data.
