<p class="browse-wallets-info">Use this Bitcoin exchange list to <a href="/find-exchange/">find the best Bitcoin exchange</a> for you. Each user has unique needs, so there is no "best" or "top" bitcoin exchange. This page, however, will help you find the best exchange for you based on your specific needs.</p>

<p>Our Bitcoin exchange reviews detail each exchange's supported countries, payment methods accepted, fees, privacy, limits, liquidity, reputation, speed (delivery of bitcoin), customer support, and any past issues.</p>

<p>This list is not yet complete. If you simply want to find a Bitcoin exchange in your country, and don't need reviews, use our <a href="/find-exchange/">find exchange tool</a> or <a href="http://bitcoinx.io/exchanges/">BitcoinX</a>.</p>
