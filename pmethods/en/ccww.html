<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>What are risks are involved buying bitcoins with credit card?</h3>
<p>First of all, make sure the company you're buying for has a good reputation and is regulated. It's possible that sketchy companies selling bitcoins may be collecting CC information and could possibly scam you later.</p>
<p>Some users have reported cash advanced fees, so be sure to understand how your CC company handles the purchase of bitcoins.</p>

<h3>What are the benefits and advantages?</h3>
<p>It can be easy to get bitcoins fast if purchasing with a debit/credit card. Since most people understand how to shop online using credit and debit cards, it may be easier for less technical buyers to use credit cards to purchase bitcoins. </p>

<h3>What are the disadvantages?</h3>
<p>It's hard to buy large amounts of bitcoins with a CC or DC. Also, the fees are higher due to the risk of fraud and scams.</p>

<h3>Buy Bitcoin with Stolen Credit Card</h3>
<p>This is not possible since you won't pass ID verification. It's also illegal, so you should not do it or try. </p>

<h3>Buy Bitcoin with Credit Card Anonymously</h3>
<p>This is illegal and you won't pass ID verification. </p>

<h3>If the limits aren't high enough for me, can I buy bitcoins on multiple exchanges?</h3>
<p>Yes, of course. If, for example, Circle's $300 per week limits are too little for you, you could buy $300 on Circle each week and also open a Coinbase account and buy an additional $150.</p>

<h3>Why was purchasing bitcoins with a credit card once difficult?</h3>
<p>Credit card payments are reversible. Actually, merchants don't receive the money from credit card payments until ~60 days after a card is swiped. Because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, it's risky for a merchant to sell bitcoins for CC payments. Companies have found new ways to prevent fraud and thankfully this has made it much easier to buy with a CC, as evidenced by the many options listed above.</p>

<h3>Is it risky giving up my ID in order to buy?</h3>
<p>It depends how much you trust the exchanges. Just like any information you give up online, there is always the risk that it can be hacked or stolen from the website you give it to. One thing that Bitcoin exchanges have going for them is that because they are constantly under attack, they have some of the best security and protections in place to protect against the hacking of your personal info. In the end, there is risk with anything related to information online. Even <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/yahoo-500-million-accounts-hacked-data-breach/">Yahoo was hacked</a> and information on 400 million accounts was stolen.</p>

<h3>Should I leave my bitcoins on the exchange after I buy?</h3>
<p>We really recommend storing any bitcoins you want to keep safe in a wallet you own. Many Bitcoin exchanges have been hacked and lost customer funds. If you don't want to fall victim to these hacks then the easiest way is to <a href="/wallets/">store your coins in a wallet you control</a>.</p>
