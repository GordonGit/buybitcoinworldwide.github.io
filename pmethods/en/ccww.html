<h3 class="wallet-type-hot">What risks are involved when buying bitcoins with credit card?</h3>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>
<p>First of all, make sure the company you're buying for has a good reputation and is regulated. It's possible that sketchy companies selling bitcoins may be collecting CC information and could possibly scam you later.</p>
<p>Some users have reported cash advanced fees, so be sure to understand how your CC company handles the purchase of bitcoins.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot">What are the benefits and advantages?</h3>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>
<p>It can be easy to get bitcoins fast if purchasing with a debit/credit card. Since most people understand how to shop online using credit and debit cards, it may be easier for less technical buyers to use credit cards to purchase bitcoins. </p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot">What are the disadvantages?</h3>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>
<p>It's hard to buy large amounts of bitcoins with a CC or DC. Also, the fees are higher due to the risk of fraud and scams.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot">Can I buy bitcoin with stolen credit card?</h3>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>
<p>This is not possible since you won't pass ID verification. It's also illegal, so you should not do it or try. </p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot">Can I buy bitcoin with credit card anonymously?</h3>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>
<p>This is illegal and you won't pass ID verification. </p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot">If the limits aren't high enough for me, can I buy bitcoins on multiple exchanges?</h3>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>
<p>Yes, of course.</p>

<p> If, for example, CoinMama's limits are too little for you, you could buy $150 each week and also open a Coinbase account and buy an additional $150.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot">Why was purchasing bitcoins with a credit card once difficult?</h3>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>
<p>Credit card payments are reversible. Actually, merchants don't receive the money from credit card payments until ~60 days after a card is swiped.</p> 

<p>Because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, it's risky for a merchant to sell bitcoins for CC payments. Companies have found new ways to prevent fraud and thankfully this has made it much easier to buy with a CC, as evidenced by the many options listed above.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot">Is it risky giving up my ID in order to buy?</h3>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>
<p>It depends how much you trust the exchanges. Just like any information you give up online, there is always the risk that it can be hacked or stolen from the website you give it to.</p>

<p>One thing that Bitcoin exchanges have going for them is that because they are constantly under attack, they have some of the best security and protections in place to protect against the hacking of your personal info. </p>

<p>There is always risk with anything related to information online. Even <a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/yahoo-500-million-accounts-hacked-data-breach/">Yahoo was hacked</a> and information on 400 million accounts was stolen.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot">Should I leave my bitcoins on the exchange after I buy?</h3>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>
<p>We really recommend storing any bitcoins you want to keep safe in a wallet you own. Many Bitcoin exchanges have been hacked and lost customer funds. If you don't want to fall victim to these hacks then the easiest way is to <a href="/wallets/">store your coins in a wallet you control</a>.</p>

<h3 class="wallet-type-hot">Can you sell bitcoins?</h3>
<div class="nice-divider-sub"></div>
<p>Out of the exchanges we listed, CEX.io is the only one that allows you to sell bitcoins to your credit card.</p>

<p>If you get one thing from this article let it be this:</p>

<p>Don't store your bitcoins on exchanges!!!</p>

<div class="quote-box">
<p>I've been buying bitcoins for more than three years. I've never lost any money to scams or thefts. Follow the guidelines in this article and you'll be able to do the same.</p>

<div class="quote-ref"><img src="/img/icons/jtsmall.jpg"><a href="https://www.jordantuwiner.com/">Jordan Tuwiner</a> <span class="position">Founder, Buy Bitcoin Worldwide</span></div>
</div>

<p>Here are two examples where users got screwed by leaving bitcoins on exchanges:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitfinex_hack">Bitfinex hack where users lost $70 million</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/03/bitcoin-exchange/">Mt Gox where users lost $450 million or more</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And there are many more I could list.</p>

<p>Make sure you <a href="/wallets/">get yourself a Bitcoin wallet</a> that will securely store your bitcoins.</p>

<p>Besides storage, there are many scam exchanges out to steal your credit card information and/or bitcoins.</p>

<p>Following these three basic principles should help you avoid theft, scams, and any other loss of funds:</p>

<ol>
<li><b>Do research before buying on any exchange.</b> Check reviews, ratings, and regulation information.</li>
<li><b>Don't store coins on the exchange.</b> Already mentioned above but worth repeating.</li>
</ol>
